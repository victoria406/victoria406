# ✨ Welcome to My GitHub! ✨

Hi there! I'm **Victoria White**, a soon-to-be graduate from **Montana State University, College of Engineering**, with a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** (🎓 December 13, 2024 🎉).  

### 🛠️ A Bit About Me:
During my internship at **Lone Peak Precision**, I gained hands-on experience with **end-to-end system design** by:
- 🔍 **Analyzing 3D files** and extracting critical data.
- 📊 **Performing backend calculations** to solve engineering challenges.
- 🎨 **Designing a user-friendly UX interface** for the project’s website.
- 🚢 **Deploying the project** to an AWS EC2 instance using Docker.

### 🚀 What I’m Up To:
- **Passion Projects:**  
  - 📄 **Job applications!** I'm meticulously tracking, analyzing, and visualizing application data—because even job hunting is an opportunity to dive into data!  
  - 🧠 **LeetCode daily grind:** Staying consistent to sharpen my problem-solving skills and keep my brain happy.  

- **Future Goals:**  
  - 📜 **AWS and Python certifications** are on the horizon (as soon as I save up for them 💸).  
  - 🌟 Designing **my take on Goodreads** (tentatively called **GreatReads**)—a fresh spin on book tracking and reviews.
