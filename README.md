âœ¨Hello!

âœ¨I am currently in my Senior year of undergrad at Montana State University studying Computer Science! I am currently enrolled in Computational Theory, Compilers, Software Engineering, Human Computer Interaction, and National Data Security! I am especially excited about learning how to build a compiler from scratch this semester as part of my senior capstone. 

âœ¨If you are interested in any of my private repositories, please email me victorialynnew@gmail.com. They are private for academic reasons!
