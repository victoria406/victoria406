âœ¨Hello!

âœ¨I am currently in my Junior year of undergrad at Montana State University studying Computer Science! I am currently enrolled in Computer Concepts and Programming Languages, Computer Security, Networks, Computer Systems, and Technical Writing! I am especially excited about learning how to build an interpretor in Haskell this semester. 

âœ¨Please contact me for permissions onto my private repositories! A majority of my projects are school related and must remain private.
